 ## Introduction 
 
For this application, Google Books API search engine has been built in MERN Stack. Other than searching for books, users can sign up and login their account to save their favorive books.I have used deployed the final app on heroku.

   
 ## Dependencies and Tools used
   * In order to run the app, I installed the required dependencies using npm install.
   * The app can run through localhost or can be used through the heroku deployed URL
   * All the information is seeded in the mongoDB database 
   * The I connected the dataase to __Mongo DB Atlas__.Atlas handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing your deployments on the AWS cloud service provider.
   *  Along with it,I deployed the app through __Heroku__ web host and Configured an additional add on  __MONGODB_URI__ in order to relate the code and database.

 
 ## App Presentation
 The web app created can be run either from the server using __localhost:3001__ or through the heroku link. The app via heroku looks something like the images shown
